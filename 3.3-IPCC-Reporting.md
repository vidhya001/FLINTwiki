**Common Reporting Framework**

The IPCC requires all national reports to be consistent with their reporting framework - referred to as the Common Reporting Framework, or CRF. The CRF includes categorisation of emission sources and sinks by sector, and is supported with a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet.  The outputs of the FLINT will be able to be reconciled against the CRF; however in general the output will be finer than is required for the CRF (i.e. pools may need to be aggregated for reporting purposes). While it is possible for the FLINT to automatically generate reports consistent with the CRF, it would remove some of the versatility of the FLINT, and would also bind up-dates to the system each time the CRF was altered. More information on the CRF can be found at www.ipcc-nggip.iges.or.jp/public/gl/guidelin/ch1ri.pdf  

**CO2 and Non-CO2 Reporting**

The FLINT is fully configurable to report on both CO2 and non-CO2 emissions. This is managed through the pool process, where pools can include any value. However, the FLINT does not yet restrict transfers from carbon to non-carbon pools – this is required to be restricted through the implementation of modules.
Of note, due to the mass balance requirements, the FLINT must include a pools, from which carbon (e.g. CO2 & CH4) and non-carbon pools (e.g. N2O) can draw values from.

**_Forest Biomes_**

The IPCC provides Tier 1 figures of above and below ground biomass by forest type (see Table 4.8, Chapter 4, Volume 4). By combining these default estimates with estimates of the area cleared by forest type obtained through remote sensing, it is possible to readily obtain a Tier 1 model of deforestation.
While there are numerous forest mapping tools available, such as the WWF terrestrial ecosystems, these are not well aligned with the IPCC biomass figures. For this reason, it is recommended that the FAO Global Ecological Zones be used for this purposes, as this will be consistent with the IPCC approach.
Originally released in 2001 and updated in 2010, the GEZ offers a map of the world’s forest zones, reflecting the IPCC categories (Table 1). Noting that these forest zones are not maps of forest cover. Separate forest cover maps will be necessary for monitoring deforestation.

Soils
As with the forest biomes, it is necessary to have a spatial representation of soil to estimates of their emissions can be completed. There are multiple maps that are available for mapping the soils. The FAO World Resource Base Map contains information on soils, which can be classified up into the IPCC reporting categories (see the below table).
