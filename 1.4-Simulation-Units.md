**What is a Simulation Unit?**

A Simulation Unit is a unit for which a module is applied. A Simulation Unit can represent a spatial area, such as a pixel or forest stand, or it can represent an emissions source, such as livestock. Where the Simulation Unit refers to a geographically referenced area, it is known as a Land Unit. 

**How are Simulation Units used in the FLINT?**

Within the databases and data-layers underpinning the FLINT, there are attributed values that describe the characteristics of each Simulation Unit.  For example, for a Land Unit there may be information on the unitâ€™s area, land type, age of vegetation, species and carbon pools. The overall framework of FLINT manages the processing of Simulation Units over time. While Simulation Units are the basis of all simulations run in FLINT, they are rarely used for reporting purposes (see Local Domain).
